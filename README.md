# AngularJS 
- Model view whatever
- Model <-> View
- Model (app) contains a controllers which is used by html which becomes a view once you use ng-app (app name)
and within a view i.e. div (you use ng-controller which comes from the ng-app from the top)
- All AngularJS services start with a $, i.e $scope

# Dependency Injection
- Giving a function an object
- Rather can creating an object inside a function, you pass it to the function

# Scope Service
- It is a big part of the thing that binds model to the view, its called scope.
- Its an object from scope service.
- It involves dependency injection.
- Scope will show a lot of functions, that is AngularJS doing dependency injection
